# Stage Detection Test Dataset
#
# Each conversation is stored once with stage markers.
# The test runner slices at each marker to generate test cases.
#
# Structure:
#   - Full message history is preserved
#   - `stage_after` on a message marks what stage the conversation is in AFTER that message
#   - Tests are generated for each `stage_after` marker using all messages up to that point

conversations:
