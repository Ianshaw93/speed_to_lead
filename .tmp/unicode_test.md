### Test 1: Patrick J. Ryan
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our outreach where they're sharing a specific business challenge (bottleneck between outreach and booking calls), which indicates interest and qualifies as a positive engagement before we've pitched a call.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> I have a bottleneck between outreach and booking calls.

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Hey Patrick appreciate the hand written note

Did you go through Cole and Dickie's ghostwriting course? I did ship30 like 13/14months ago

Dig the personal side of your posts

Solid focus on execs. Is it specifically EEC rather than content you do? How's outreach going on here? Is this the main client acq channel for you
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Hmm, that's a specific bottleneck

Is it a volume issue? Or more about the messaging not converting?

And is this outreach happening on LinkedIn?
```


### Test 2: Catherine Long, MHRD, PROSCI® Certified Change Practitioner
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our outreach where they acknowledge our offer and provide a specific reason for not engaging immediately, indicating interest but with a timing objection.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> Ian, I'm so slammed the next 2 weeks, I'd have to push that idea down the road unfortunately....  I so appreaciate your offer.

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Of course Catherine - you welcome. Like how you connect to business outcomes in your headline btw. The closer to the money you can be - the easier it is to ask for it hahaha

7 figure revenue shift is a strong case study for sure

Is it the founders/ceos that you reach out to?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Of course - no worries at all. Timing is everything

How's the client pipeline looking otherwise? Still finding CEOs through word of mouth?
```
