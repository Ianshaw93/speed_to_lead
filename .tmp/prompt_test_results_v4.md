## Positive Reply (Rapport Building)


### Test 1: Joyce PBIS
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our outreach, showing engagement by sharing their project (iquotehero.com) and providing feedback on our profile, which indicates interest and opens the door for further conversation.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> Hi Ian. Love that your an engineer with a passion for family and solutions. 
I’m bootstrapping iquotehero.com PaaS engine 

Joyce. 
Ps. it’s a super challenge to read your about section. May I suggest white space as an asset ? 

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Thanks Joyce. Appreciate the feedback on the profile - I see what you mean re-reading it actually

iQuote looks interesting by the way. Tracking trust building actions - that's neat

So key in differentiating in the post AI world

When you say bootstrapping - does that mean no active users at the minute?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Appreciate the feedback on the profile - I see what you mean re-reading it actually

iQuoteHero looks interesting btw. PaaS engine for what exactly?

When you say bootstrapping - does that mean no active users at the minute?
```


### Test 2: Patrick Hennessy
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's second substantive reply in the conversation, showing engagement by commenting on the file format, but we have not yet pitched a call or meeting.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> the file came out looking like ancient Egyptian

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
The activity score is key as it reflects prospects who are more likely to reply. Where it gets juicy is where we have a fuller picture of the pain points of your icp. Then we can find those saying directly they have those. Dr Amy P is one of those

I included the linkedin profiles for you. Is LinkedIn a main driver for clients for you? Or more word of mouth/warm outreach?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Ah sorry about that - must have been a weird export

Naturopath founders is a solid niche

How's it going on here? Good # of clients? Or nah
```


### Test 3: Soumyadeep Mondal

**First reply:** False

**Lead's message:**
> Cool

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Sounds good. 

https://calendly.com/scalingsmiths/discoverycall

Should have space still Fri/Sat 
```

**What AI generates NOW:**

Of course

How's business going? Good traction?
```

**First reply:** False

**Lead's message:**
> Cool

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Appreciate that

I'd be down to look under the hood see if/how I can help you get similar results on here on a call later this week. Wanna do that? Up to you
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Of course

How's it going on here? Good # of clients? Or nah
```


### Test 5: Colin Cimino
**Stage:** positive_reply | The lead has been actively engaging in conversation, answering questions about their business and client acquisition channels, but we haven't yet pitched a call or meeting. The conversation is still in the rapport-building and qualification phase.
**First reply:** False

**Lead's message:**
> For brands LinkedIn and social media 

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Gotcha. Not a tiktok user myself. How does views transfer to business outcomes? Is that more b2c high volume offers

How do you reach out to the founders? Ads? Content or what
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Gotcha. So you're using both channels for brand clients.

Hmm - is it mostly inbound from your content? Or do you do outreach too

And what's the typical deal size with a brand?
```


### Test 6: Colin Cimino
**Stage:** positive_reply | The lead is actively engaged in conversation, answering questions about their business and client acquisition channels, but we haven't yet pitched a call or meeting. This is still in the rapport-building and qualification phase.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> For brands LinkedIn and social media 

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
That's cool man. I lived in Lnd for a year. I like how there's entire sub cities that are completely different there. Like Brixton where it's all Caribbean food and music everywhere

400k huh? Is that followers for clients or what? Is that mostly ig/tt? Ever help founders on here
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Gotcha. So content and social for B2C, LinkedIn for B2B brands.

What's the main goal for the brands you work with? Brand awareness or direct sales?
```


### Test 7: Brody Zastrow
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our initial outreach, showing interest by confirming their role and asking about the purpose of the connection, but we haven't pitched a call yet.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> Hello Ian, yes I am feeling an independent sponsor as well as an M&A advisor
 
Appreciate the outreach was there something in particular that you were looking to connect about?

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Gotcha Brody - I actually have a good friend who is currently raising 3ish $mill providing AI systems for manufacturing orgs. Solid niche to be in. So many are still using monolithic software and a small % in efficiency can mean 7+ figures

Like the focus on those that are perhaps not tech handed. We've scaled several offers past $25k/mo on here focusing on our in  house signal sensor system - to track signals that an owner has a pain point that would be solved through partnership/exit. Including age bracket, not having AI/modern infra, engaging in relevant content to succession issues etc

Have actually put together a prospect list. Just want to check I've read you icp correctly before sending over. Lmk

### Test 8: Loeka W.
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive engagement with multiple replies, showing interest by sharing results and asking for feedback, but we haven't pitched a call or meeting yet.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> Let me know your thoughts

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Aloha Loeka. Are you hawaiian my friend? I was working with good few of your Polynesian brothers if so. Banana farming in Australia. They were mostly from Samoa

Respect for you starting your own venture

I bet the winners manage the cofounder conflict well hahaha. Are the founders you target on here you feel?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Got it - thanks for sharing the raw data.

Interesting approach. What kind of founder metrics are you looking for when you hand pick?
```


## Pitched (Call Invitation)


### Test 1: Patrick J. Ryan
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our outreach where they're sharing a specific business problem (bottleneck between outreach and booking calls), which indicates interest and qualifies as a positive engagement before we've pitched a call.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> I have a bottleneck between outreach and booking calls.

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Hey Patrick appreciate the hand written note

Did you go through Cole and Dickie's ghostwriting course? I did ship30 like 13/14months ago

Dig the personal side of your posts

Solid focus on execs. Is it specifically EEC rather than content you do? How's outreach going on here? Is this the main client acq channel for you
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Hey Patrick

Gotcha - so the outreach is working but the calls aren't booking

Is it a volume issue? Or more the replies not converting?
```


### Test 2: Catherine Long, MHRD, PROSCI® Certified Change Practitioner
**Stage:** positive_reply | This is the lead's first substantive reply to our outreach where they're engaging with our offer, showing interest but with a timing objection. We haven't pitched a call yet, and they're responding to our qualification question about who they work with.
**First reply:** True

**Lead's message:**
> Ian, I'm so slammed the next 2 weeks, I'd have to push that idea down the road unfortunately....  I so appreaciate your offer.

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Of course Catherine - you welcome. Like how you connect to business outcomes in your headline btw. The closer to the money you can be - the easier it is to ask for it hahaha

7 figure revenue shift is a strong case study for sure

Is it the founders/ceos that you reach out to?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Of course - no worries at all

Totally get being slammed

What kind of projects are keeping you busy with CEOs right now?
```


### Test 3: Bernard Baah
**Stage:** positive_reply | The lead has provided a substantive reply showing interest in discussing positioning and strategy, asking for our take on key business decisions, but we haven't yet pitched a call or meeting in the conversation history.
**First reply:** False

**Lead's message:**
> Hey Ian — appreciate you checking in.

Short answer: yes, our buyers are definitely on LinkedIn, especially founders, operators, and CEOs in the 20–300 employee range. That said, we’re being deliberate about how we activate LinkedIn.

Right now:
→ We close primarily via sales calls (and some in-person for local businesses)
→ Product is very early post-launch after internal usage
→ We’re focused first on tightening messaging + proof points before scaling outbound

So calls are coming in, but we’re not yet pushing aggressive LI systems until:

We lock in 2–5 strong case studies

Messaging clearly differentiates us from “generic HR software”

We decide whether we’re selling HR software or execution OS for leadership (very different angles)

Your docs are useful — especially around positioning and volume — but we’re optimizing first for signal over scale.

If you’re open to it, happy to get your take on:
→ Whether you’d push Filly HR as high-ticket + consultative vs mid-ticket + systemized
→ And what you’d sharpen first in the positioning if this were your product

Cheers 👊

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Appreciate you sharing that brother 

Do you close with sales calls or all through website? Have you got paying users already 
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Appreciate the thoughtful reply man

Love the deliberate approach - signal over scale is smart early on

Hmm so you're getting calls already from where? Just inbound from the site?
```


### Test 4: Bernard Baah
**Stage:** positive_reply | The lead has provided a substantive reply showing interest in discussing their business strategy and asking for specific advice on positioning and pricing, but no meeting has been pitched or scheduled yet.
**First reply:** False

```

**What AI generates NOW:**

Appreciate the thoughtful reply Bernard

Love the deliberate approach - signal over scale is smart early on

Hmm on the positioning question. Is the main pain you solve for leadership the lack of visibility into team performance? Or more about driving actual task completion?

## Calendar Sent


### Test 1: Vikas Pandey

**Lead's message:**

**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Gotcha. Like to hear you have that positive word of mouth/referrals working for you. Tough to scale without that

You know I'd be down to look under the hood sometime next week. See if/how we can help you convert cold traffic on here. And not be relying on referrals. Wanna do that? Up to you
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Got it. Book any slot and I'll reschedule it for next week.

## Booked


### Test 1: Doug Huete
**Stage:** pitched | The user has just responded to the lead's latest message by proposing specific days (Mon/Tue) for a call, which constitutes a clear meeting invitation. The lead previously expressed openness to discussion and asked ROI questions, but no calendar link has been sent yet.
**First reply:** False

**Lead's message:**
> i’m open to a discussion. It’s just that today was not a good day.
And I would be looking to enhance our clients’ outreach with a system that has proven performance metrics

Anything that performs well under scrutinyshould be viewed as an asset. 

The question is
How long does it take to get a return on investment?



**What was actually sent (approved):**
```
Understood

Like to hear it's a proven system. Would be interested to dive deeper into that

Our kpi is 4+ calls/wk. We've sold deal sizes ranging up to $25k on linkedIn

ROI is dependent on quite a few things - not least their icp and deal size

Would need to dive deeper on the call 

Are you free some time Mon/Tue?
```

**What AI generates NOW:**
```
Got it

Our kpi is 4+ calls/wk. ROI depends on their ICP and deal size

```


### Test 2: Doug Huete
**Stage:** regeneration | The conversation had stalled after the lead expressed interest in booking a call but didn't follow through, and our latest message on Feb 19 is a re-engagement attempt after a significant time gap (13 days) since the last exchange.
**First reply:** False

Appreciate the energy Doug

People don't have an issue with an AI msg. They have issues with messages that are not relevant to them

Finding prospects showing signals of pain points just improves results 10 fold
