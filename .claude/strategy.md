# Growth Strategy & Prioritization

## Current Funnel (2026-02-21)

```
1,723 Prospects
  270 Conversations      (15.7% reply rate)
   63 Positive Reply     (23% of conversations)
    9 Pitched            (14% of positive replies — BOTTLENECK)
    3 Calendar Sent
    2 Booked
   93 Pending drafts (unanswered)
```

## This Week's Focus

1. **Fix AI draft quality** — in progress (separate instance). 0/136 drafts were usable due to 4 bugs (wrong message roles, no prospect context, generic prompts, regen bug). Fix ships this week.
2. **Work the backlog** — regenerate and send the 93 pending drafts once fix is live.
3. **Reply fast** — speed to lead on incoming responses.
4. **Content 5 posts/week** — ongoing habit (was 2 last week, ramping to 5).

## Levers to Push Later (ordered by priority)

### 1. Engagement / Commenting
- **What:** Commenting on prospects' posts before/after connection request
- **Why:** Warms prospects, increases accept rate and reply quality
- **Time cost:** 5-10 hrs/week
- **When:** After draft fix is live and reply pipeline is flowing

### 2. Scale Connection Volume
- **What:** Increase HeyReach from 30/day to 40-50/day
- **Why:** More top-of-funnel at same conversion rates doubles downstream
- **Time cost:** Near-zero (HeyReach config change)
- **When:** Only after you can handle the increased reply volume — no point adding more if you can't respond

### 3. Improve Follow-Up Docs
- **What:** Two Google Docs sent in automated HeyReach follow-ups
  - "B2B Scale Engine" (3-pillar framework, $25k/mo case study)
  - "Differentiation Framework" (story-driven, voice-note outreach, Travis case study)
- **Current state:** Fine. Both have specific case studies, clear CTA (15-min LinkedIn Growth Audit). Structure is a bit repetitive across the two (same problem→pillars→case study→CTA format).
- **Why later:** They're generating 15.7% reply rate already. Polishing them is marginal vs fixing the conversion leak.
- **When:** Once reply→pitched→booked is healthy

### 4. Lead Magnets / New Content Assets
- **What:** Additional downloadable resources for outreach sequences
- **Why:** Can improve reply rate and position authority
- **Time cost:** Medium (creation + design)
- **When:** After core conversion is fixed and content cadence is stable

### 5. Buying Signal Targeting
- **What:** A/B test already running — standard DM vs buying-signal DM
- **Why:** Better targeting = higher positive reply rate
- **Time cost:** Near-zero, already automated
- **When:** Check A/B results after sufficient sample size, then double down on winner

## Decision Framework

Used Dickey Bush framework: score each lever on Impact (1-5) and Effort (1-5).

**Rule of thumb:** Don't optimize top-of-funnel until bottom-of-funnel converts. Pouring more water into a leaky bucket wastes volume. Fix the leak first, then scale.
